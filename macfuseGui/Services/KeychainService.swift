// BEGINNER FILE GUIDE
// Layer: Core service layer
// Purpose: This file performs non-UI work such as mount commands, process execution, validation, persistence, or diagnostics.
// Called by: Called by view models to execute user actions and background recovery work.
// Calls into: May call system APIs, external tools, Keychain, filesystem, and helper services.
// Concurrency: Runs with standard synchronous execution unless specific methods use async/await.
// Maintenance tip: Start reading top-to-bottom once, then follow one user action end-to-end through call sites.
