// BEGINNER FILE GUIDE
// Layer: View model orchestration layer
// Purpose: This file transforms service-level behavior into UI-ready state and user actions.
// Called by: Called by SwiftUI views and menu controllers in response to user input.
// Calls into: Calls into services and publishes state changes back to the UI.
// Concurrency: Runs on MainActor for UI-safe state updates; this means logic is serialized on the main actor context.
// Maintenance tip: Start reading top-to-bottom once, then follow one user action end-to-end through call sites.

import AppKit
import Foundation
import Network
import ServiceManagement

// This actor is a lightweight semaphore for async work.
// Why it exists:
// - A user can trigger many operations quickly (connect/disconnect/refresh).
// - We want parallel work, but not unbounded parallelism that could overload the app.
// - The limiter allows up to N in-flight operations and queues the rest.
/// Beginner note: This type groups related state and behavior for one part of the app.
/// Read stored properties first, then follow methods top-to-bottom to understand flow.

    /// This is async: it can suspend and resume later without blocking a thread.
    func acquire() async {
        if inFlight < maxConcurrent {
            inFlight += 1
            return
        }
        await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
            waiters.append(continuation)
        }

@MainActor
// RemotesViewModel is the main "brain" of the app.
// Practical reading order for beginners:
// 1) Public action methods (connect/disconnect/refresh/save/delete/test).
// 2) runOperation(...) which routes everything through one operation pipeline.
// 3) performConnect / performDisconnect / performRefreshStatus.
// 4) Recovery methods (periodic, wake, network restore).
// 5) Browser helpers and diagnostics helpers near the end.
//
// Design note:
// This file intentionally centralizes orchestration so key invariants do not drift:
// - desiredConnections remains the source of recovery intent
// - one active operation per remote, with explicit conflict policies
// - anti-flap status refresh and bounded timeouts
// Refactors should prefer extracting pure helpers while keeping state ownership and orchestration here.
//
// Why @MainActor:
// - @Published properties are read by SwiftUI/AppKit UI.
// - Running this type on the main actor avoids UI data races.
// - It does not mean all heavy work runs on the main thread; async service calls still suspend.
/// Beginner note: This type groups related state and behavior for one part of the app.
