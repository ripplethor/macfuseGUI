# macfuseGui Marketing Site Assets

This directory contains the static assets for the `macfuseGui` marketing website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## File Structure

- `site.css`: Custom styles for glassmorphism, gradients, and specific visual tweaks that extend Tailwind.
- `site.js`: Logic for:
  - Theme toggling (Dark/Light) with `localStorage` persistence.
  - Dynamic GitHub repo links (configured via `CONFIG.repo`).
  - Hero release version hydration from the GitHub Releases API (with fallback text).
  - FAQ accordion behavior (ARIA-compliant).
  - Copyright year auto-update.
- `hero-bg.webp`: Local hero background image (Unsplash source, converted to WebP for performance).
- `og-image.webp`: Social preview image in WebP format.

## Configuration

To change the target repository for download/GitHub links, edit `site.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  repo: "ripplethor/macfuseGUI"
};
```

## Theme System

The theme system uses a pre-paint script in `index.html` to prevent flashing. It checks `localStorage` first, then system preference.
State is toggled via the button with `id="theme-toggle"`.

## Development

The site stays fully static, but Tailwind CSS is compiled ahead of time for production delivery and the docs HTML is minified during the build step.
Source and output files:

- `tailwind.input.css`: Tailwind input with the custom dark variant and docs-relative source scanning.
- `tailwind.generated.css`: compiled utility CSS committed alongside the static site output.

Useful commands from the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run docs:build
npm run docs:check
```

All asset paths must stay **relative** (e.g., `assets/site.css`, not `/assets/site.css`) so the site works in both:
- custom-domain root hosting (current production: `https://www.macfusegui.app/`)
- GitHub Pages subdirectory previews (for example `/macfuseGui/`)

## Deployment

1. Commit changes to `main`.
2. Go to repository Settings -> Pages.
3. Select Source: `Deploy from a branch`.
4. Branch: `main`, Folder: `/docs`.
5. Save.
