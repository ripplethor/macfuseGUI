// BEGINNER FILE GUIDE
// Layer: Automated test layer
// Purpose: This file verifies production behavior and protects against regressions when code changes.
// Called by: Executed by XCTest during xcodebuild test or IDE test runs.
// Calls into: Calls production code and test fixtures with deterministic assertions.
// Concurrency: Runs with standard synchronous execution unless specific methods use async/await.
// Maintenance tip: Start reading top-to-bottom once, then follow one user action end-to-end through call sites.
