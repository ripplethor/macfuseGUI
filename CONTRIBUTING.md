# Contributing Guide

This guide is for developers who are new to this codebase.

## 1) Read Before Editing

Start here, in this order:
1. `README.md` for build/run/test commands.
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system flow.
3. `AGENTS.md` for safety contracts and invariants.

If your change touches connection logic, recovery, or browser sessions, read all three first.

## 2) Setup and Build

From repo root:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/run.sh
```

## 3) Reliability Gate (Required)

Before finishing a change, run:

```bash
scripts/audit_mount_calls.py && xcodebuild -project macfuseGui.xcodeproj -scheme macfuseGui -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' test CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Why:
- `audit_mount_calls.py` enforces explicit `operationID` forwarding into `MountManager` calls.
- Tests cover concurrency, timeout handling, recovery behavior, and browser/session invariants.

## 4) High-Risk Areas

Treat these as sensitive:
- `RemotesViewModel` operation supervision logic
- `MountManager` connect/disconnect/refresh behavior
- `UnmountService` timeout and cleanup behavior
- Browser session actors and request-ordering logic
- App startup/quit lifecycle in `AppDelegate`

## 5) Safety Rules

Do not break these rules:
1. One active operation per remote ID.
2. Cross-remote operations can run in parallel (bounded by limiter).
3. `desiredConnections` remains the source of recovery intent.
4. No shell interpolation for user-controlled inputs.
5. No password or secret logging.
6. Preserve anti-flap refresh behavior.
7. Preserve browser sticky-cache and empty-confirm behavior.

## 6) Diagnostics for Bug Reports

If reporting a bug, include:
1. App menu -> `Copy Diagnostics` output.
2. Steps to reproduce.
3. Whether the issue happened after wake/sleep, network change, or manual action.
